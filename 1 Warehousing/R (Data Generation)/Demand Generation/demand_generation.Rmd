Contained in this notebook is the generation of the demands 60 customers.

# Setting up

As required, we set the seed to 1, to allow for the reproducability of our results

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

#Demand Generation

We are required to generate 60 demands, drawn uniformly, between 1 and 25.

```{r}
#Generate 60 random variables between 1 and 25
demands <- data.frame(ceiling(25*runif(60)))
```

We next assign the each demand and customer, for ease of use in AMPL, and write the output to a csv file.

```{r}
#Assign row names
row.names(demands) <- paste0("c", 1:60)

#Write output to csv file
write.csv(demands, "demand_data/demands.csv", row.names = T)
```
