Contained in this notebook is the product specific insurance simulation

As required, we first set the seed to 0, for reproducability of our results.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

# Function Definitions

```{r}
poisson_gen <- function(t) {
  return(1/12+t) 
}
```

# Simulation 

We are first given some parameters, which are initialised below

```{r}
n_0 <- 0

t_A <- 
t_D < Inf
```

```{r}
for (i in range(1000){
  
  if ((t_A =< t_D)) {
    
  }
}
```
